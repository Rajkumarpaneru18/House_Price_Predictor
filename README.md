## Problem Statement
Nepal is experiencing rapid urbanization, resulting in significant fluctuations in the real estate market. The lack of reliable data and predictive tools makes it difficult for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents to make informed decisions regarding property prices. This creates uncertainty and can lead to either overpricing or underpricing of properties, making the real estate market inefficient and often inaccessible to average citizens.
